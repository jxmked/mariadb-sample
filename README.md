# mariadb-sample

Using single database to sync two interfaces (Web, CLI). 

## Requirements
 
**Environments and module/libraries**

  - Atleast `Python` 3.10
  - Atleast `PHP` 8.0
  - Atleast `NodeJS` 16.18
  - Atleast `mariadb` 10.9

---

### Installation
 
 In Termux, you can execute `$ bash install.sh` to automatically install some required
 packages, modules, sub modules and library.
 
 > Note: For all new with MariaDB, you can use the link I provided from `install.bash`
 > for steps how to setup MariaDB in Termux.
 > Save your MariaDB username and password in all .env files inside of this folder
 > This will allow Python and PHP to access your database.
 > Import database and table structure from `scheme` folder.

 > If your MariaDB is not set properly, you can use option number 4 (Use JSON as Database)
 > In Python CLI but you're limited in that database which means that database is only
 > accessible for Python CLI and completely independent from other databases.

## Start up and play

 1. Build web assests (js, css) files using this command `$ npm run build`
 2. Start MariaDB service by using `$ mysqld`. This will start Daemon service and create .sock file.
 3. Start new session then run host your `PHP` API and `Web` Interface using this command `$ npm run serve`
 4. You can now access `Web` interface using `http://localhost:8080/` and you API `http://localhost:8000/`

**To Start `Python` Command Line Interface (`CLI`)**

You can access it by...
 - Use `$ cd cli` then execute Python `main.py` script

 > Note: In some cases, option number 3 (Use Hosted REST API via 000Webhost) might fail randomly
 > due to a problem to my code or technical error. IDK but hopes to it work well as expected.
 
 > And you can see realtime changes [here](https://jxmked.github.io/mariadb-sample/).

 > And every user is limited upto 10 database changes such as insert, edit, delete and 
 > automatically reset in 30 minutes. But you may still get success message in after doing so (watch out for that).

I'll try to upload some video on how to setup this thing in Termux.

But now... Thanks... ‚ù§
